After catastrophic deletion, user insisted 'there must be a way' rather than accepting loss. This persistence led to: (1) Discovering PhotoRec had silently succeeded with wrong syntax, (2) Finding 418 recovered files from new-directions, (3) Extracting project structure from coverage reports, (4) Partial recovery becoming possible. Lesson: When recovery seems hopeless, exhausting all options can yield results. Also: User correctly identified need for sandboxing and took responsibility ('my fault for that and for trusting you'). This shared accountability is healthy - it prevents blame cycles and focuses on prevention.
