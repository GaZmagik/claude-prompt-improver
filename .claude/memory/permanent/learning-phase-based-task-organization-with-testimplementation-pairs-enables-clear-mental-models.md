Organizing 109 tasks into 9 logical phases (Foundation, Classification, Tool Detection, Skill Matching, Agent Suggestions, LSP Integration, Spec Awareness, Memory Integration, Session Context) allows mental switching between test-writing and implementation modes. Each phase has clear boundaries with test stubs created first.
