Running /speckit:review with 7 parallel expert agents (security, performance, TypeScript, Node.js, code quality, test quality, docs) identified 12 critical issues including test cheating patterns and performance bottlenecks that 90%+ coverage metrics alone missed. Test quality agent found 3 high-severity issues despite excellent coverage.
