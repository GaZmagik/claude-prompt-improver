Memory curator agent identified 3 superseded architectural decisions (classification reversal) that had accumulated during the feature work. The curator automatically flagged them as outdated/conflicting, prompting user review and cleanup. This prevented confusion during code review and ensured decision graph stayed current. Pattern: Use memory curation for pre-shipping quality checks to catch accumulated technical debt in decision history.
