Post-MVP remediation demonstrated effective SDD execution: 6-phase systematic approach (file structure fix, security fixes, code quality, test coverage, refactoring, performance) with 100% task completion and TDD discipline maintained throughout (no test failures on first implementation). 650 tests passing, integration test target exceeded by 120% (22 vs 5-10 planned).
