Updated improver prompt instruction from 'ADD structure using XML tags if helpful' to 'ALWAYS structure the output using XML tags'. Referring to https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/use-xml-tags showed that XML is a best practice, not optional. Model compliance improved after change.
