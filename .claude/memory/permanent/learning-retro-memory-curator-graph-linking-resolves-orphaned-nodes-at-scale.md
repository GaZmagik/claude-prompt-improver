Memory curator agent successfully identified semantic relationships across 49 memories and created 11 strategic edges to resolve all 13 orphaned nodes. Approach: grouped by topic (TDD evolution, config redesign, test coverage, security), then created cause-effect and progression relationships. Result: graph health 70→100/100, connectivity 73.5%→100%. Key insight: orphaned nodes often have strong semantic connections to hub nodes - curator pattern works well at scale.
