Systematic pattern for memory cleanup after session restore: (1) Delete duplicate/orphaned memories identified by curator agent, (2) Consolidate similar memories with consistent naming, (3) Link orphaned nodes in batches by category, (4) Verify health score improves. Improved post-MVP remediation memory from 70/100 to 100/100.
