Writing all 70+ tests before implementation (Red phase) forced clear thinking about feature requirements and edge cases. The test suite became the specification. Even though test fixtures need updates, the core feature tests are precise and guide implementation cleanly. Recommendation: Always write full test suite first, then defer fixture updates if they're mechanical.
