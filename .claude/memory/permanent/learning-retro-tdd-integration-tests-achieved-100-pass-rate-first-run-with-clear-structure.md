Writing 22 integration tests using TDD (test structure first, then implementation) resulted in all tests passing on first execution. Clear test naming (full-flow, bypass-scenarios, error-handling) made it easy to verify implementations. Test structure matched existing patterns (integration.spec.ts). Recommend TDD for new test categories.
