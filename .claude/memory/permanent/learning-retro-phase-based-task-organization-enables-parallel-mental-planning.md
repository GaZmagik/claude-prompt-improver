Organizing work into 10 phases with clear dependencies (Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phases 2-4 parallel → Phases 5-9 parallel → Phase 10) allowed continuous thinking about future phases during implementation. Checkpoint states clarified when to validate or pause. Accelerated decision-making about trade-offs (MVP vs advanced features).
