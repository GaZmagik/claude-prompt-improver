Completed entire specification-driven development cycle (explore → specify → plan → tasks → analyze) for Dynamic Context Injection v1.3.0 in one session. Time investment upfront (2.5 hours planning) enables confident implementation phase. The structured workflow with automated validation (speckit agents) caught inconsistencies early and reduced risk. Key benefit: moving from problem statement to 145 executable tasks with 100% requirements coverage took one focused session rather than iterative refinement across multiple sessions.
