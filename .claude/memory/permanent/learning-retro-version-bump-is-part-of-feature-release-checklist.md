Bumped version twice during this session (first forgot it, reviewer caught it, then added YAML parsing and forgot again). Pattern: when releasing features, version bump should be part of the commit workflow. Consider: (1) pre-commit hook to catch version mismatches, (2) checklist in PR template for version updates, or (3) scripted version management. This session showed good review process caught it, but preventative is better.
