Structuring the post-review cleanup plan into Must Do (1.5h), Should Do (2-3h), and Nice to Have (2-3h) phases allowed delivering concrete value early while giving user clear options to continue. User chose to continue with both should-do and nice-to-have items, resulting in 6 commits and 22 new tests. This tiered approach works well for improvement work.
