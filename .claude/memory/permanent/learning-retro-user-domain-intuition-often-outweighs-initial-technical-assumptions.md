User correctly intuited that PhotoRec could recover .claude and .specify directories despite initial assessment that 'only coverage HTML files survived'. This led to discovering 376 memory files (2.1 MB) and 361 spec files (165 MB) - majority of project knowledge. When facing uncertain recovery scenarios, validate user's domain knowledge and explore alternative recovery angles before accepting conclusions. This session recovered 1,122 files vs. initial estimate of ~500.
