Comprehensive multi-expert review (code quality, security, performance, tests, docs, TypeScript, Node.js) found zero critical issues but flagged mock-heavy tests, config default mismatches, unused constants, and timeout race conditions. Security and TypeScript patterns exemplary. Report: .specify/specs/feature/001-prompt-improver-plugin/review-report-2026-01-21T14-08Z.md
