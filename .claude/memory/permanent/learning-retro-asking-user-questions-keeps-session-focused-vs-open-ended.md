Used AskUserQuestion tool multiple times (branch strategy, exploration approach, next steps after PR). Each time, user's answer immediately clarified direction and prevented over-thinking. Example: user said 'skip /plan, go straight to implement' wasn't viable, so we ran plan anyway - turned out to be essential. Pattern: When uncertain about direction, ask rather than assume. Keeps conversation interactive and prevents wasted effort on wrong paths.
