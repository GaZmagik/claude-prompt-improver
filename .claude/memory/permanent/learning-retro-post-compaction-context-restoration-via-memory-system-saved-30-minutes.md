After compaction reset mid-implementation, resuming work could have required re-reading 50+ files and re-establishing context. Instead: memory system provided instant summary of 83 linked memories, including recent decisions (visibility-mvp strategy), artifacts (typescript patterns), and gotchas (manifest schema). Memory curator confirmed 100/100 health score with zero duplicates. Enabled seamless continuation within 5 minutes. Lesson: Disciplined memory capture during sessions is force multiplier for asynchronous development (forked sessions, compaction cycles). Investment in memory hygiene pays off exponentially during recovery.
