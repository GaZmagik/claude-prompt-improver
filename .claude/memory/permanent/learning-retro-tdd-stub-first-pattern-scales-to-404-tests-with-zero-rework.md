Creating stubs with touch, writing failing tests first (red), then implementing (green) proved highly effective across 8 phases. All 404 tests passing indicates strong test coverage. Pattern prevents premature implementation and clarifies contracts upfront. Recommend as default for multi-phase feature development.
