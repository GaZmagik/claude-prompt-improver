Workflow: (1) Research phase documents decisions in spec; (2) Create test stubs with Bash touch; (3) Write all tests (red phase); (4) Implement code (green phase); (5) Run typecheck + tests; (6) Mark task list complete; (7) Update tasks.md checkboxes. This ensures spec-code alignment and comprehensive coverage before moving to next phase.
