Systematic approach to post-MVP remediation: Phase 1 (File structure fix), Phase 2 (Spec/README updates), Phase 3 (Code cleanup with linting), Phase 4 (Test coverage expansion), Phase 5 (Refactoring duplications), Phase 6 (Performance optimizations). Each phase builds on previous; test suite must pass after each phase. Patterns: must-do items (structural), should-do items (quality), nice-to-have items (performance). Verified working on 13 items across hooks project (650 tests passing).
