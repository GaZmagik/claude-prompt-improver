In this session, recognizing that old test fixture updates (adding new required fields like 'level' and 'phase') were mechanical busywork, we deferred them to focus on core feature implementation (Phases 2.4-2.7). This kept momentum high: 521 tests passing, core features complete. Recommendation: Categorize fixture updates as 'mechanical' vs 'logical' - defer mechanical updates when they don't block core feature validation. Batch them later.
