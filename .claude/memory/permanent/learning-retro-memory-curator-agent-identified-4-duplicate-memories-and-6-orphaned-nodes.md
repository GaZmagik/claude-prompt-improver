Memory cleanup after session-restore revealed significant duplication:

- Duplicate context restoration memories (2) - kept more detailed version
- Duplicate conditional property pattern artifacts (3) - consolidated into single comprehensive artifact
- Orphaned TDD and Visibility MVP memories (6) - created 12 linking relationships

Result: Graph health improved from 93% to 100% connectivity (0 orphans, 87 nodes, 90 edges).

Key insight: Memory curation agents are effective at identifying graph health issues. Should run memory-curator as regular maintenance task. Pattern: High recent memory creation → run curator → identify duplicates/orphans.
