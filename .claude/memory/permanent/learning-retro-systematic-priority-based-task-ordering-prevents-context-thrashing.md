In this session, ordering work as MUST FIX (critical docs) → mandatory security review → HIGH priority code fixes → MEDIUM priority code fixes kept focus sharp and prevented getting lost in scope creep. Each tier built on previous work, preventing the need to re-context-switch. Recommend always front-loading blocking items and deferring optional improvements.
