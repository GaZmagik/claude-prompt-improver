Decision from deliberation: Prioritise observability features (improvement reports, structured JSON logging, bypass reason logging) over additional improvement algorithms. Structured logging enables diagnostic data collection without exposing sensitive prompts. MVP scope: 3 features (reports, logging, force override) targeting 2-3 hour implementation with test-first TDD compliance.
