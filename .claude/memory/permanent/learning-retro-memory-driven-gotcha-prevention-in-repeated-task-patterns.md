When working on similar tasks across sessions (e.g., integration tests, refactoring), checking memory for previous gotchas at phase start prevents repeating the same mistakes. In this session, memory gotcha about reading function signatures before writing tests prevented the exact same integration test failures that occurred in H3-H4 phase. This saved iteration cycles and demonstrates value of structured memory recall.
