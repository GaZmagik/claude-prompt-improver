PR #25 reviewer flagged 6 improvements (1 HIGH, 1 MEDIUM, 4 LOW). Rather than merge-and-forget, we addressed all of them: security validation docs, regex robustness, timeout constant extraction, caching, format function tests, module documentation. Result: higher quality code and clearer reviewer feedback loop. Takes more time upfront but reduces technical debt.
