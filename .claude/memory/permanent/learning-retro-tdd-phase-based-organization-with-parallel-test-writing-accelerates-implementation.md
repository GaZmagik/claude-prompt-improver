Writing all tests for a phase first (Red phase) before implementation (Green phase) prevented rework. Phases 4-5 averaged 32+ tests written upfront, then implementation followed naturally. This pattern reduced iteration cycles and clarified requirements. Future phases should maintain this: all tests first per phase, verify failures, then implement all tasks.
