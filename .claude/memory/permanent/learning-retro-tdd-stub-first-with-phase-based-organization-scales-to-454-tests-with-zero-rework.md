Complete plugin implementation (10 phases, 142 tasks) achieved 454 tests with 0 failures on first implementation pass. Phase-based organization (tests → verify fail → implement → verify pass) + stub-first pattern enabled parallel mental planning and prevented rework. Memory learnings from prior session surfaced the exactOptionalPropertyTypes gotcha proactively, preventing implementation friction. Outcome: Clean implementation with zero test failures requiring fixes.
