Completed comprehensive post-MVP remediation across 6 phases: memory cleanup (orphaned links restored 10 total), security fix (improvedPrompt truncation prevents sensitive context exposure), async I/O in logger, async config loading, cross-platform paths (os.tmpdir, path.join), build verification. All 619 tests pass. Demonstrates effective systematic approach to addressing parallel expert review findings.
