Launching 7 expert agents in parallel (code-quality, security, performance, test-quality, documentation, typescript, nodejs) completed v1.2.0 comprehensive review in ~5 minutes with zero redundancy. Each agent operated independently with clear scope boundaries. This approach is scalable and should be default for pre-shipping reviews. Key: Agent specialisation prevents overlap and enables parallel execution.
