Decided to implement three focused features: (1) System messages with bypass/applied/failed states showing what happened to the prompt, (2) Structured logging with log levels and security-conscious prompt previews, (3) Force improve toggle for testing. This focused approach solves the core visibility problem without over-engineering.
