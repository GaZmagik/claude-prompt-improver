Post-compaction workflow using session-restore with 3 parallel agents (memory-recall, memory-curator, check-gotchas) successfully restored full context. Memory recall identified 8 active gotchas + work status. Curator linked 14 orphaned nodes. Check-gotchas surfaced 1 critical + 5 high-severity items. Total: 3 agents running ~5min total wall time with separate context budgets. Prevented manual context rebuilding and maintained memory system integrity.
