Breaking dynamic-context-injection into 6 phases (research, infrastructure, agents, multi-source, memory-think, integration) made it easy to track progress and manage context switching. Completed phases 0-3 in one session with 65 passing tests. Phase-based checkpoint system (with README notes) keeps work organized and prevents scope creep.
